Assistance on pd.cut from Chat GPT:

To categorize spending based on the specified bins using pd.cut, you can do the following:
pythonCopy code

import pandas as pd

# Assuming you have already established the bins and labels
spending_bins = [0, 585, 630, 645, 680]
labels = ["<$585", "$585-630", "$630-645", "$645-680"]

# Create a copy of the school summary DataFrame since it has the "Per Student Budget"
school_spending_df = per_school_summary.copy()

# Use pd.cut to categorize spending based on the bins.
school_spending_df["Spending Ranges (Per Student)"] = pd.cut(school_spending_df["Per Student Budget"], bins=spending_bins, labels=labels)

# Display the updated DataFrame
print(school_spending_df)
In this example, we assumed you have a DataFrame called per_school_summary that contains the "Per Student Budget" column, and you have already established the spending_bins and labels lists. We then create a copy of per_school_summary called school_spending_df and use pd.cut to categorize the "Per Student Budget" based on the spending_bins. The results will be stored in a new column called "Spending Ranges (Per Student)" in the DataFrame school_spending_df.
